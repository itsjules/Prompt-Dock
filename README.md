# PromptDock

PromptDock is a local, lightweight desktop tool designed for students and creators to build better AI prompts using modular "building blocks."

## Key Features
- **Global Hotkey:** Access your library instantly using `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P`.
- **Modular Blocks:** Assemble prompts like Legos (Role, Task, Context, etc.).
- **Fuzzy Search:** Find prompts and blocks fast, even with typos.
- **Import & Dissect:** Paste any prompt to break it down into reusable components. Or skip the dissection of the prompt if you dont need the blocks.
- **Local & Private:** Your data stays on your machine—no accounts or cloud sync required.
